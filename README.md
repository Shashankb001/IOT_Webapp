The integration of Internet of Things (IoT)
and Deep Learning for paediatric autism detection has yielded promising results
in our study. The developed system successfully collected and analyzed
real-time behavioral data from a diverse dataset encompassing both Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and neurotypical children. The Deep Learning algorithms
demonstrated efficacy in extracting subtle patterns and features indicative of
potential ASD markers, showcasing the system's potential for early and accurate
detection.
